        <h2>1. Ransomware</h2>
        <p>Imagine your computer files are locked and held hostage by a digital bandit. This cybercriminal demands money from you to release your files. It's like your computer is kidnapped, and you have to pay a ransom to set it free.</p>

        <h2>2. Phishing</h2>
        <p>Picture this: You receive an email that looks legit, like it's from your bank or a trusted website. But, surprise! It's actually from a sneaky imposter trying to trick you into sharing sensitive information, like passwords or credit card details. It's like fishing for your personal info with a fake bait.</p>

        <h2>3. Malware</h2>
        <p>Think of malware as the bad apples in the digital world. Malicious software (malware) can infect your computer and cause harm, like viruses or spyware. It's like a virtual disease that you want to avoid catching on your devices.</p>

        <h2>4. Social Engineering</h2>
        <p>Envision someone using psychological tricks rather than technical skills to manipulate you. Social engineers might pretend to be a friend, colleague, or even tech support to get you to reveal confidential information. It's like someone playing mind games to gain access to your personal data.</p>
