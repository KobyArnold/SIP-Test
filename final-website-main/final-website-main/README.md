# final-website
The primary start-up page that links to every other page will be the main.html page. I've currently installed temporary measures, but I still plan to locate or make images and apply CSS code to them. Apart from establishing the main.html page as the primary hub connecting to many sites, my intention is to enhance the user experience by integrating captivating images and refining the layout using CSS styling. Finding or producing pertinent photos that fit the website's concept will take precedence over placeholders. In addition, my goal is to optimize the CSS code to guarantee uniformity in design components, adaptability to various screen sizes, and a visually coherent overall presentation.
