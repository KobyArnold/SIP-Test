            <h2>1. Password Management</h2>
            <p>Imagine your online accounts are like fortresses, and your passwords are the keys. To keep your digital kingdom safe, create strong and unique passwords for each account. You can use password managers like LastPass or 1Password to help you remember and generate complex passwords. These tools are like trustworthy keykeepers for your online castles.</p>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>2. Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
            <p>Think of two-factor authentication (2FA) as an extra layer of protection. It's like having a backup key to your digital fortress. Enable 2FA on your accounts whenever possible. This usually involves receiving a code on your phone or email in addition to entering your password. It's an extra step, but it adds a powerful shield against unwanted intruders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>3. Secure Web Browsing</h2>
            <p>Picture the internet as a bustling marketplace with both safe and shady stalls. To stay safe, always look for the "https://" in the website's address. It's like a stamp of approval, indicating a secure connection. This "s" stands for secure and ensures that the data exchanged between you and the website is encrypted, like a secret code only you and the website can understand.</p>
            <p>Moreover, keep an eye out for websites that display a padlock icon in the address bar. This icon indicates that the site has an SSL/TLS certificate, which adds an extra layer of security. It's like the digital equivalent of a shop having a security guard – you know it's taking extra measures to protect your information.</p>
            <p>Additionally, be cautious about clicking on unfamiliar links. Think of it as navigating through the internet's marketplace with a vigilant eye for trustworthy shops. If a website looks fishy or doesn't have the "https://" and padlock, it's like a stall in a dark alley – best to steer clear to avoid potential digital pickpockets.</p>
            <p>By checking for "https://" and the padlock icon, you're ensuring that your online interactions are with trusted, secure vendors in the vast internet marketplace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice">
            <h2>4. Email Security</h2>
            <p>Imagine your email inbox as your digital mailbox. Treat it like you would your physical mailbox – be careful what you open! Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown senders. It's like being cautious about the mail you receive to prevent digital "mail scams." Also, if an email asks for sensitive information, double-check its legitimacy by contacting the sender through a verified method.</p>
